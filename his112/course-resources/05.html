        <h2>Section Five: Resources for Citing</h2>

        <h3>Introduction to Citations</h3>

        <p>Citations are short references to published or unpublished sources that writers use to show where they got their facts, evidence, ideas, and conclusions.</p>

        <p>Depending on what &quot;style&quot; of citation that you use, your references might take the form of <em>footnotes</em>, or your references might consist of <em>parenthetical citations.</em> If you use parenthetical citations, you will have a &quot;Works Cited&quot; list at the end of your essay.</p>

        <p>Using citations in any academic formal essay is always a good idea, just be sure to confirm with your professor which citation style you should use. Generally speaking, different academic disciplines use different styles. For example, history professors use Chicago Style citations, while literature professors use MLA Style citations.</p>

        <h4>Why Bother Citing?</h4>

        <p>It's important to cite sources for several reasons. Your goals when citing are:</p>

        <p>To show your reader you've done proper research by listing sources you used to get your information</p>

        <p>To be a responsible scholar by giving credit to other researchers and acknowledging their ideas</p>

        <p>To avoid plagiarism by quoting words and ideas used by other authors</p>

        <p>To allow your reader to track down the sources you used by citing them accurately in your paper by way of footnotes, a bibliography or reference list</p>

        <h4>How Do I Learn How to Cite?</h4>

        <p>There are a number of good resources on the web that can teach you how to cite in the appropriate style for your assignment. See the appendix for web sources on using citations.</p>

        <p>Also it's never a bad idea to consult your school's librarians or writer center staff for help.</p>

        <p>Finally, you can sometimes look to sample essays for clues on how to cite. If your assigned class readings include any scholarly essays (a.k.a. &quot;secondary sources&quot;), see if they might provide appropriate models for citations. Otherwise, check the web sites listed in the appendix for sample papers.</p>

        <p>As with anything in writing, the best way to become an expert at citing is to start doing it. Ultimately, what's most important is not that you get every punctuation mark of your citations exactly right. What's important is that you embrace the <em>spirit</em> of citing. That means understanding <em>why</em> we cite, and writing in a way that is true to the goals of citing as are enumerated above.</p>

        <h3>Citations: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3>

        <p>Q: When should I cite a source?</p>

        <p>A: When you look at a source to write a sentence, you should cite it. The exception is if the information is common knowledge. A good test if something is common knowledge is to ask if you could relatively easily find six or more sources with that information. When in doubt, cite.</p>

        <p>Q: How often do I need to cite? Where do citations go?</p>

        <p>A: Citations come at the end of a sentence. If multiple sentences in a row in the same paragraph draw from the same source(s), you may place the citation at the end of the last sentence in the sequence.</p>

        <p>Q: What if I need to put more than one source in a citation?</p>

        <p>A: Separate the two sources with a semicolon.</p>

        <p>Q: How do I cite a lecture?</p>

        <p>A: Much as you would anything else. Even if your style guide's website doesn't have explicit instructions on how to cite a class lecture, you can follow the <em>spirit</em> of citing by including as much relevant information as you have.</p>

        <p>That includes: the &quot;author&quot;'s name (that is, the lecturer), the name of the lecture (put this in quotes), the place the lecture was given (the name of the college is fine), and the date that the lecture was given.</p>

        <p>Q: How do I know which edition of a reading to cite?</p>

        <p>A: You should always cite the publication that is in front of you. The idea is that the page numbers should mean something to your reader. So for example, if you are reading an excerpt of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein in an anthology, the page numbers you are using are those of the anthology, not of Mary Shelley's original work. If your citation didn't note that you were reading an anthology, your reader would be awfully confused when they went to Mary Shelley's book itself to look up the page numbers.</p>

        <p>Here's an example of a citation of one of our readings---provided in both MLA and Chicago styles---that does well in showing that it is a re-publication of an earlier text:</p>

        <p>MLA (bibliography):</p>

        <p>Isherwood, Christopher. The Berlin Stories. 1935, 1939. New Directions, 1963.</p>

        <p>Chicago (footnote):</p>

        <p>Christopher Isherwood, The Berlin Stories (1935, 1939; repr. New York: New Directions, 1963), [page number].</p>

        <h4>FAQs for Chicago/Turabian Style</h4>

        <p>Q: How do I make a footnote?</p>

        <p>A: Place the cursor after the period of your sentence, and type CTRL-ALT-F on a PC, or CMD-ALT-F on a Mac. As an alternative, choose &quot;insert footnote&quot; from the Insert menu. DO NOT TRY TO MANUALLY INSERT NUMBERS. If you have to do that, you're doing it incorrectly. Don't confuse footnotes with footers---these are two different things.</p>

        <p>Q: What should my footnote look like? What information does it need?</p>

        <p>A: See the following website: <a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/books/turabian/turabian_citationguide.html">http://www.press.uchicago.edu/books/turabian/turabian_citationguide.html</a> for examples of how to format a footnote. The examples you need are those with &quot;1.&quot; in front of them. (The ones without numbers are for formatting references pages---ignore this.)</p>

        <p>Q: What if I am citing an article or document that is published inside of a larger collection?</p>

        <p>A: Visit the above linked website, and scroll down to &quot;Chapter or other part of a book.&quot; Remember to follow the example with &quot;1.&quot; in front of it.</p>

        <p>Q: Do I have to write out the full footnote every time I cite the same source?</p>

        <p>A: No, after you cite something once, you can use a &quot;short&quot; form each subsequent time. Short forms are shown on the website above, in the examples with &quot;2.&quot; in front of them. Remember, you still need to include the page number.</p>

        <h4>FAQS for MLA Style</h4>

        <p>Q: What needs to go in the parentheses?</p>

        <p>A: It depends on your sentence. If you have explicitly referred to the author of your source already, you only need to put the page number(s) that you are referring to. And if there are no page numbers in your source, you can omit the parentheses entirely. On the other hand, if you do not mention the author in your running text, you should put the author's last name in the parentheses, along with the page number(s) as necessary, separated by a comma. See Purdue's OWL MLA Website for examples: <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01/">https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01/</a>. (Scroll all the way down to see how to write in-text parenthetical citations.)</p>

        <p>Q: What should my works cited page look like? What information does it need?</p>

        <p>A: Your works cited page must include every source that you reference---even the ones that didn't need parentheses. Visit above linked Purdue page to see how the components of a source are assembled to make an entry. Then click on the pages linked on the left hand column for more examples, such as &quot;books&quot; and &quot;periodicals.&quot;</p>

        <p>Q: What if I am citing an article or document that is published inside of a larger collection?</p>

        <p>A: Visit <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/06/">https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/06/</a> and scroll down to &quot;A Work in an Anthology, Reference, or Collection&quot; for examples.</p>

        <p>Q: What if I end up using two sources in my paper by the same author?</p>

        <p>A: In this case, you need to include the title of the work in your parenthetical citations. See this page for more information: <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/02/">https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/02/</a>.</p>
