        <h2>Section Two: Resources for Reading</h2>

        <h3>Active Reading Strategies</h3>

        <h4>What is Active Reading?</h4>

        <p>Reading for academic purposes is different than reading an e-mail from a friend or a front page newspaper article. You're not reading for pleasure, but you're not reading simply to accumulate facts either. You're reading to understand a concept, its relevance, and one author's stance or perspective on it, so you can figure out where that reading sits in relation to <em>your own</em> existing understanding and/or point of view.</p>

        <p>Active reading can take many forms. For example, if you're reading a 21st century textbook, you will find different strategies useful then if you were reading a 19th century political speech. This document addresses general active reading, then covers strategies more useful for primary sources and argumentative essays and books, and finally addresses textbook reading.</p>

        <h4>Why do Active Reading?</h4>

        <p>You will understand better, and retain knowledge longer using active reading strategies. That means writing assignments will be easier and you'll get higher grades. Active reading also makes what you are reading more relevant to you, and thus more enjoyable to read.</p>

        <h4>How do I Do It?</h4>

        <p>There's something of an art to active reading, and everyone does it differently. Nevertheless, there are some good guidelines to get started:</p>

        <p>&quot;Chunk&quot; what you are reading into chapters, headings, subheadings, and even individual paragraphs. When you reach the end of every section, write down what you think is the purpose of that chunk. Then look over the next section and take a guess about what it will be about.</p>

        <p>With every paragraph or two, consider what the author wants you to get out of it. What do they know that you don't? What is the author trying to tell you? Write it down.</p>

        <p>Consider how the section relates to what you already know about the topic. Is it a different perspective or set of facts than you previously encountered? Does it contradict your previous understanding? Or does it make you think of something, even if it is seemingly off-topic, in a new way? Write it down.</p>

        <p>What do you know that the author doesn't? In other words, do you disagree with the author? Do you have a different set of experiences? Do the author's ideas seem outdated or irrelevant? Write it down.</p>

        <p>Write down any concepts or words that are confusing or don't make sense. Write down any concepts or words that seem to be used differently than your previous understanding of them. Write down any concepts that seem to be important to the author, ones that recur throughout the section or reading.</p>

        <p>Write down any sentences or quotes that appear particularly striking. Write down sentences that you like, ones that you dislike, and ones that you find confusing. Always note the page number.</p>

        <h4>Assessing the Text</h4>

        <p>One purpose of active reading is to engage in the twin &quot;critical thinking&quot; tasks of what we might call &quot;perspective taking&quot; and &quot;assumption hunting.&quot; In addition to the above exercises, approaching your text with these two ideas can be a way to get more out of reading.</p>

        <p>These tasks work <em>especially</em> well when you're working with argumentative essays and books, or with primary sources. Primary sources are items that are created by historical figures from the past. We study them not because they are &quot;true&quot; or &quot;correct,&quot; but because they are first hand documents, they help us learn about historical people and events.</p>
        <h5>1. Context Gathering</h5>

        <p>Whatever you're reading, it's a good idea to start with some basic information gathering. Write down:</p>

        <p>When was this written? Where was it written? By whom?</p>

        <p>Who is the primary audience supposed to be for this?</p>

        <p>Why was it written? For what purpose?</p>

        <p>Sometimes, the answers to these questions aren't so obvious, and informed speculation can be helpful in these instances.</p>
        <h5>2. Perspective Taking</h5>

        <p>One of the core tasks of critical thinking is putting yourself in the shoes of others. This is sometimes called &quot;cognitive empathy.&quot; Sometimes we think of empathy of &quot;feeling badly&quot; for someone, but this is a misnomer. Empathy is an <em>intellectual</em> move. Perspective taking means trying to understand or extrapolate an author's motivations and intent. Doing so is a means of really understanding what the text is saying. And it's also a way of &quot;flexing&quot; your own thinking processes, by looking at a concern or issue from different angles.</p>

        <p>For each chunk that you read, write down the author's motivations or intent. Consider: What are their hopes, dreams, or goals? And why does the author hold them?</p>
        <h5>3. Assumption Hunting</h5>

        <p>This is the flipside of perspective taking. It requires you to take a critical, even cynical stance, as you approach a reading. Assumption hunting isn't so much about asking what an author or text is hiding or leaving out---though that's important too. It's about trying to understand what is taken for granted, or what is assumed. At the heart of assumption hunting is the search for the systems of thought that have influenced the author. In other words, if a writer or reading is <em>biased</em>, it's usually because there are cultural norms at play. Assumption hunting is at heart about identifying those norms or biases that are shaping the author and the text.</p>

        <p>For each chunk, write down the assumptions that you think the author makes, and write down the systems of thought, or <em>ideologies</em>, that the author appears to subscribe to, and consider why they do. Consider also: What are the author's fears? What do they misunderstand?</p>

        <p>Remember, we all have biases---biases can be good and bad---and we all have perspectives or ideologies that shape what we assume and take for granted to be true. In practicing critical thinking, we can perform both of these tasks on ourselves as well as the works of others.</p>

        <h4>Reading a Textbook</h4>

        <p>Reading a textbook sometimes requires different strategies than those that are mentioned above.</p>

        <p>You will likely find yourself &quot;disagreeing&quot; with the author much less, for example, since authors of textbooks try to make themselves as agreeable as possible! And similarly, the strategies mentioned in the &quot;Assessing the Text&quot; section might be more or less useless when you're reading a textbook, because the author isn't really trying to convince you of anything. (Although they probably are, in a way.)</p>

        <p>So what <em>does</em> matter when reading a textbook?</p>

        <p>You can still find use out of &quot;chunking&quot; strategies. It's a great idea to make an outline of each textbook chapter, since textbooks are usually very carefully organized. Write out an outline of a chapter before you start reading it. Then, as you go, fill it in with short summaries for each section.</p>

        <p>Textbooks usually have key terms that are presented in bold text. Write down each bold term, along with its definition, and why you think it is significant.</p>

        <p>Pay careful attention to the introductory and concluding paragraphs of each chapter. This is where you can generally find some of the &quot;big ideas.&quot; (This goes for works that are not textbooks too.)</p>

        <p>It's a great idea, even when reading textbooks, to write down anything that you find counter-intuitive, confusing, or surprising.</p>

        <h4>Writing is Thinking</h4>

        <p>The common thread in all of the exercises above is <em>writing</em>. Writing while you read is shown to be <em>dramatically</em> more effective than underlining or highlighting. Next time you reach for the highlighter, think about writing down some notes, thoughts, and reactions instead.</p>

        <h3>What is a Primary Source?</h3>

        <p>At the core of the work of historians is primary source analysis. Primary sources are, in short, items from the past that historians study to understand history firsthand.</p>

        <p>Examples of primary sources:</p>

        <p>A newspaper article from the time of the Civil War.</p>

        <p>A jazz record album from the 1920s.</p>

        <p>A speech delivered by a politician in the 1970s, that was written down so that people could read it later.</p>

        <p>A handwritten letter that a soldier wrote home to his family during World War II.</p>

        <p>An interview with someone recalling their lived, firsthand experience of a past event or time period. (These interviews are a special kind of primary source, known as &quot;oral histories.&quot;)</p>

        <h4>What Is <em>Not a</em> Primary Source?</h4>

        <p>In the field of history, primary sources are firsthand evidence. So if a historian writes a book about a time period, he or she uses primary sources. But the book that they create is not a primary source itself. It is a &quot;secondary source.&quot;</p>

        <p>We can learn about history from secondary sources just as we can from from primary sources. But they are different. Secondary sources are works of analysis. They are carefully created works of study.</p>

        <p>Examples of secondary sources:</p>

        <p>A popular nonfiction book about one of the &quot;founding fathers.&quot;</p>

        <p>A documentary motion picture about the 1960s Civil Rights Movement.</p>

        <p>A textbook about the entire history of the United States.</p>

        <p>A Wikipedia article about the Great Depression.</p>

        <p>A lecture delivered by a college professor about the Mexican-American War.</p>

        <h4>Why Do Historians Read Primary Sources?</h4>

        <p>Primary sources are not the work of scholars or experts. They are written by all kinds of people: world leaders and enslaved people, men and women, honest individuals and corrupt and fallible ones. That makes reading primary sources a little tricky, but also a lot of fun.</p>

        <p>Instead of simply reading them for facts, we read them to try to understand people's points of view, their hopes, fears, worldviews, motivations, assumptions, and biases too. Primary sources might not always be &quot;true,&quot; but they can always tell us something about the past.</p>

        <h3>Watching for Bias in Primary Sources</h3>

        <h4>What is bias?</h4>

        <p>Primary sources are biased. Bias is a tendency toward a particular feeling, inclination or point of view. Anything you write will reflect your thoughts and inclinations Often when bias is discussed we hear about a bias against groups---racism or ageism, for example. But bias can refer to any particular inclination or point of view. If you love cats and hate dogs, or vice versa, a paper you write about pet ownership will probably reflect your bias. Your way of thinking influences what you believe and what you write. This is true of primary source creators too.</p>

        <h4>Bias in primary sources</h4>

        <p>Historical writings were created by people whose opinions and experiences influenced their point of view and this is reflected in what they wrote.Two people discussing the same place at the same time might have two very different points of view.</p>

        <p>For example; a man in the Washington territory in the 19th century who is writing a letter to convince his childhood sweetheart to move west and marry him might make the place sound very different than it would sound in the letter sent home by a disillusioned and bankrupt settler telling his family his farm has failed and he is headed back east.</p>

        <p>Both of these writers are biased. They still offer valuable insights, but evaluating primary sources for bias is important, and using more than one primary source can be helpful for seeing the bigger picture.</p>

        <h4>What should you do when you encounter bias?</h4>

        <p>You can still write about and analyze biased sources. But you have to do more than to say simply that the source is &quot;wrong.&quot; The trick is to do some &quot;assumption hunting.&quot; Write about the motivations and ideas behind the views that are being expressed. Here are some informal writing exercises that you might use to begin to sketch out your ideas:</p>

        <p>First, <em>always</em> gather the context of the source. Who wrote it? When, where, why? And to whom? (Who is the audience?) <strong>This is the one step that you should always do.</strong></p>

        <p>Identify the &quot;-isms&quot; or &quot;norms&quot; behind the author's worldview (aka &quot;ideology&quot;), and how they influence what the source is saying.</p>

        <p>Identify the purpose or motivation behind what the author is writing. You can empathize with an author even if the source is expressing ideas you believe to be wrong or misleading.</p>

        <p>Contrast the source with a different source from the same place and period, one written from a differing perspective. This helps identify how different people had different biases, depending on their motivations or worldviews.</p>

        <h3>Encountering Primary Sources in the Wild and on the Web</h3>

        <h4>Where Do We Find Primary Sources?</h4>

        <p>Unless you're at the National Archives, or a dusty old library somewhere, you're probably looking at a primary source in one of two places:</p>

        <p>A web page or PDF on the internet</p>

        <p>An &quot;anthology,&quot; or published collection of many primary sources</p>

        <p>(You might find primary sources in other places too. For example, you could also pick up an old autobiography of a Native American activist from your local library, <a href="https://archive.org/details/indianboyhood00east">or on the internet</a>, and that would be a primary source too.)</p>

        <h4>What Should I Watch Out For When Reading Primary Sources in the Wild?</h4>

        <p>One of the trickiest parts of reading a primary source that comes from the internet or an anthology is distinguishing between the writing itself, and what the editor or website administrator has added.</p>

        <p>So when you are reading a primary source, carefully ask yourself the following questions:</p>
        <h5>Have I identified the &quot;head note&quot;?</h5>

        <p>Usually, a primary source will include an introduction that was written recently. This is called a &quot;head note&quot; and can be very useful to read. It's not really part of the primary source though.</p>
        <h5>Is the title at the top of the webpage or anthology entry the original title of the source, or did an editor create a new title?</h5>

        <p>Often times an editor will make up a title for the primary source. It can be useful to distinguish between a title that a document had at the time it was originally created and read, and the source's title as it's been given by an editor on the web or in an anthology.</p>
        <h5>Have I correctly identified the year that the source was created and/or published?</h5>

        <p>The webpage or anthology might have a publication date of 2017, when the document was actually created in 1841. It is useful to be able to distinguish the difference!</p>
        <h5>Have I ignored anything that the editor has added that isn't useful to me?</h5>

        <p>Some things that editors do are useful, such as providing head notes. Other things might not matter to us, for example, putting chapter numbers on primary sources that aren't relevant to the source's original context.</p>

        <p>Also, sometimes editors will place discussion questions after a primary source, and these might not be important to us, although it doesn't hurt to read these anyways.</p>

        <p>Finally, some of the &quot;source&quot; or &quot;citation&quot; information that an editor provides might not be useful. You should ignore any source information that doesn't tell you the <em>original</em> context in which the primary source was created, produced, distributed, and/or read or seen. For example, if a source is a speech that was originally delivered in 1910, we don't really care that the editor has found the text of the speech in a book that was published in the 1970s.</p>

        <h3>Finding the Argument in a History Article</h3>

        <p>You've probably written a paper before where you had to write an &quot;argument,&quot; or a &quot;thesis statement.&quot; So you know what an argument is---it's a statement that you make, one that can be argued against, and one that your paper is going to &quot;prove&quot; or &quot;back up.&quot;</p>

        <p>You may have even been required to underline your thesis statement before you turned in your paper. By underlining your thesis, you showed your professor where to look to find your argument.</p>

        <p>This makes sense, because it turns out that locating arguments in other people's writings can be surprisingly tricky.</p>

        <p>One reason for this is that sometimes essays can have <em>nested</em> arguments, or what to appear to be variety of arguments. Another reason is that different disciplines---like history, or psychology---sometimes have particular standard practices that aid seasoned readers to understand what the argument is, but can be confusing to people unaware of the accepted practices of that discipline.</p>

        <p>In any case, here are some tricks to finding the argument in a journal article (or book) written by a historian. I'm assuming that you know what an argument---or thesis---is; if you don't, <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/thesis-statements/">here's a primer</a>.</p>

        <h4>Look to the Start and the End of the Article</h4>

        <p>Most often, thesis statements appear in the first few pages of a journal article. If the journal article is broken up into sections, the argument will likely be in that first section.</p>

        <p>Less commonly, you may find the argument in the last few pages of the article, or if there are sections, in the final one.</p>

        <h4>Look for &quot;Signposts&quot;</h4>

        <p>Scholars often signal their argument by using certain language. For example, they might say &quot;this article will show that...&quot; or &quot;I am going to illustrate in the following pages that...&quot;. Sentences like this are sure signs that you've hit on an argument.</p>

        <p>Also, look for language that positions the author's article in conversation with other writers. Phrases might look like: &quot;Contrary to XXX's findings,...&quot; or &quot;Other scholars have neglected the role of...&quot;. These kinds of statements show that the author is arguing <em>against</em> a contrary viewpoint or conclusion to the one that their article is going to make.</p>

        <h4>Test: Does the Argument Align with the Evidence?</h4>

        <p>Once you have a candidate for a possible argument/thesis, do a quick test: does the bulk of what the article is about seem to support, or &quot;back up&quot; the argument? If not, keep looking.</p>

        <h4>Test: Is the Argument <em>Causative?</em></h4>

        <p>Because history is at its core about identifying cause-and-effect, or &quot;causation,&quot; you can be fairly certain that a historian's argument is going to make a claim about the cause(s) of an event.</p>

        <p>Again, once you have a candidate for the author's argument, you can test it. See if makes a <em>causative</em> explanation.</p>

        <p>If you've identified an argument that does <em>not</em> seem to be contributing to our understanding of something's cause, you might want to see if what you have is really the author's central argument.</p>

        <h4>Test: Is the Argument <em>Interpretive?</em></h4>

        <p>If a historian is not making a causative argument, they might be making an interpretive one. Is the paper examining a series of statements, documents, or other pieces of evidence to come to a conclusion about an individual or group's motivations, ideas, or actions? That conclusion might be the central argument.</p>

        <h4>Beware the &quot;Significance&quot; Trap</h4>

        <p>It's likely that if you have an argument that's not <em>causative</em>, and not <em>interpretive</em>, you've fallen into the significance trap. Often times, historians will include statements alongside their arguments that testify to their article's significance. They don't just want to tell you something, they also want to tell you <em>why it matters today</em>.</p>

        <p>While significance is important, you don't want to confuse it with the paper's core argument---the statement that the author is trying to prove with their research and analysis.</p>

        <h3>Independent Research: How Can I Tell if a Secondary Source is Credible?</h3>

        <p>We all know that these two truths exist:</p>

        <p>The internet is an excellent place to find information.</p>

        <p>The internet is filled with lies, exaggerations, opinions, and unconfirmed facts.</p>

        <p>How then should do we tell what's true and what's not on the internet? Your best bet is to focus on finding and relying on credible sources.</p>

        <p>There are <em>entire courses</em> devoted to answering the question as to what makes a credible source. For now, let's focus on some quick ways that you can gather reliable information.</p>

        <h4>Periodicals</h4>

        <p>Periodicals are a great place to start a search for information, particularly if you are writing about politics or current events. Start with daily news sources. Often referred to as the country's &quot;paper of record,&quot; the <em>New York Times</em> is a good place to start. Other national papers including the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, the <em>Washington Post</em>, and the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> are known to be reliable sources of information. Local newspapers can vary in reliability.</p>

        <p><strong>There is one caveat when dealing with the newspapers listed above:</strong> Essays that are marked as &quot;Opinion&quot; should not be taken as objective fact. And often, these are not even fact-checked. Opinion pieces are good for understanding someone's point of view, but they are not good sources of straight up information.</p>

        <p>Magazines often also have a point of view, and it can be much more difficult to tell the line between an opinion essay and an investigative one in a magazine. For this reason, you should be careful with magazine articles. The best thing you can do is to try to confirm one article's facts by comparing it with an article from a different periodical or other kind of source.</p>

        <h4>Academic Journals</h4>

        <p>If you know how to search academic journal databases like <em>Google Scholar</em> or <em>JSTOR</em>, the results that you get will be generally reliable, because they are written by experts, and usually are the outcome of a process called &quot;peer-review.&quot; That means that other scholars have weighed in on the validity of the author's article in a systematic way.</p>

        <p>And if you don't know how to search academic journals, ask a librarian. They will be more than happy to help you.</p>

        <h4>Books</h4>

        <p>Books come out of a similar, though generally less rigorous process, whereby editors and advance readers determine if a book is accurate. But not all books are the same. The best way to tell if a book has been reviewed for accuracy is to find a book published at an academic press. Such a book will list as its publisher something like &quot;University of California Press&quot; or &quot;M.I.T. Press.&quot;</p>

        <p>Otherwise, if a book's publisher is: &quot;Penguin,&quot; &quot;Norton,&quot; &quot;Random House,&quot; Hachette,&quot; &quot;Macmillan,&quot; &quot;Harper Collins,&quot; or &quot;Simon &amp; Schuster,&quot; or a similarly recognizable name, there's a decent chance that it is reliable. But books published by non-academic presses can vary widely in reliability. The most important thing to do with publishers such as these is to look at the &quot;About the Author&quot; section. Check to see if the author is a scholar or an expert.</p>

        <p>Stay away from books that are or appear to be self-published and/or only in e-book format.</p>

        <h4>Government Websites</h4>

        <p>Websites that end in &quot;.gov&quot; are generally reliable sources of information. You should still consider how they might be biased---a Department of Defense webpage might have a different intention than a State Department webpage, for example, just because the former's purpose is to deal with antagonistic countries, and the latter's purpose is to deal with friendly ones.</p>

        <h4>Wikipedia?</h4>

        <p>Wikipedia is a great <em>starting</em> point for research on the internet. But it's just that: a starting point.</p>

        <p>It's a good idea to follow the footnotes and links at the bottom of the page. While any information that you find on a Wikipedia page is untrustworthy on its own, you can assess each linked source that you click on and determine if it's reliable.</p>

        <p>* * *</p>

        <p>Regardless of the source, you should always ask a couple of questions:</p>

        <p>Is there a newer source for this information? Older sources may have been reliable at one time, but they may now be outdated. This goes for <em>all</em> of the sources listed above.</p>

        <p>What is the author's motivation or intent? All author's have a purpose for publishing, and everyone has biases. But looking out for displays of bias can help you weed out unreliable sources.</p>

        <p>And as always, be sure to cite your source, even if you are not taking a direct quote. And <em>never</em> simply copy and paste text from a source as if it were your own words.</p>
