        <h3>About Your Professor</h3>

        <p>I received my doctorate in history from the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis in 2014. There I studied the politics of the red scare in Hollywood that followed World War II, and the impact of the red scare on the culture of film and television in the postwar period. My broad research interests include 20th century American comparative race and ethnicity, and popular culture. I endeavor to use poststructuralist philosophy to try to understand the political and cultural shifts of the past half-century in American history.</p>

        <p>Way before any of that, I grew up near Boston, MA. After living in Austin, TX for six years, I spent the next seven years living in Minneapolis. That means I've lived in a number of different kinds of cities, and I'm happy to now call Asheville my home. When I'm not reading or writing about history, or watching or writing about movies, or just reading for pleasure, I enjoy going on early morning runs around town, cooking vegan food, and baking sourdough bread.</p>

        <h3>How to Use <em>Course Resources</em></h3>

        <p>This collection of instructional content has been edited and assembled by your professor, specifically for his classrooms and online learning spaces. It includes a range of pages on reading and writing that are designed to help you do better on, and get more from, the specific readings, discussions, activities, and assignments with which you'll be engaging.</p>

        <p>That means it's worth your time to give these pages a look. It also means that you'll likely want to keep this resource handy as a <em>reference</em>. In other words, you'll find it convenient to return to its pages each week, as you complete your activities, re-reading only what is relevant to you at that moment.</p>

        <p>You may find that some pages are more valuable or relevant to you than others, and that's fine. The purpose behind this resource is to make sure that you have what you need to succeed in this class. You may also find that the lessons, tips, and tricks that you learn from the following pages will help you in other classes that you take too.</p>

        <h3>How to Succeed in College</h3>

        <p><strong>Ask questions.</strong> You're here to learn. So asking questions isn't a sign of a failure of intelligence, it's a sign of intellectual curiosity and engagement.</p>

        <p><strong>Take notes.</strong> In class. All the time. Even if your classmates are talking, they are likely to say something that you will want to recall later. And being able to do so will improve your work. Also, taking notes not only helps when you need to refer to them later, but it also increases your learning at the moment of your taking them. It's just how the brain works.</p>

        <p>Take notes when you're doing the readings too. Studies prove that you retain more and deeper knowledge when you're writing as you're reading.</p>

        <p><strong>Don't read anything on your phone.</strong> You simply can't engage deeply with words that way. If you have no other screens, print it out instead.</p>

        <p><strong>Aim to do at least some work for each of your classes every day.</strong> This is another habit that is proven to be beneficial. Even if it's just for a few minutes, touching your work <em>every day</em> keeps what you need to be thinking about at the forefront of your mind, and reduces the tendency to procrastinate.</p>

        <p><strong>Keep an open, empathetic, and critical mind.</strong> &quot;Open&quot; means you are open to questioning your own assumptions. &quot;Empathetic&quot; means reading others' writing with an understanding that they have something important to say. &quot;Critical&quot; means reading others' writing with an understanding that you bring your own experiences, background, and knowledge to reading others, and that's important too, even when what you are reading is by an &quot;expert.&quot;</p>

        <p><strong>Read a reputable newspaper or news magazine regularly.</strong> You'd be shocked at how it improves your success with and enjoyment of all of your courses, including ones in math and science. That's because the more you can make real world connections, the deeper you can engage with your coursework.</p>

        <h3>Introduction to History</h3>

        <h4>What We Talk About When We Talk About History</h4>
        <blockquote>

            <p>History, as nearly no one seems to know, is not merely something to be read. And it does not refer merely, or even principally, to the past. On the contrary, the great force of history comes from the fact that we carry it within us, are unconsciously controlled by it in many ways, and history is literally present in all that we do. It could scarcely be otherwise, since it is to history that we owe our frames of reference, our identities, and our aspirations. And it is with great pain and terror that one begins to realize this. In great pain and terror one begins to assess the history which has placed one where one is and formed one's point of view.</p>

        </blockquote>

        <p>James Baldwin, 1965</p>

        <h4>Rules of Thumb for Thinking About History</h4>

        <p>Talking about history can be weird, challenging, unsettling, and even scary? So how should we do it? Here are three rules of thumb:</p>
        <h5>1. Don't Use &quot;We&quot;</h5>

        <p>Don't use &quot;we&quot; when writing about the United States or about its people.</p>

        <p>So instead of saying &quot;we went to war with Spain in 1898,&quot; you should write &quot;The United States went to war with Spain in 1898.&quot; This shows that you are being objective. And more accurate too. After all, you and I definitely didn't go to war in 1898!</p>
        <h5>2. Know the Difference Between &quot;Heritage&quot; and &quot;History&quot;</h5>

        <p>Someone once said that &quot;heritage&quot; is &quot;aspects of our past that we want to keep.&quot; When your hometown throws a parade to celebrate its elders or its long-passed ancestors, that's a celebration of &quot;heritage.&quot; Heritage is something that usually makes people feel good, and that's important---it brings communities together and gives meaning to people's lives.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, &quot;history&quot; is something a little different; it's the careful and considered conversation and debate that happens around the meaning of the past. History is a critical mode of inquiry. Whereas heritage generally involves nostalgia, pride, and celebration, history can be happy as well sad, joyful as well as frustrating. Nevertheless, it's nearly always thought-provoking and important too.</p>
        <h5>3. Consider the Other Side of the Coin</h5>

        <p>When you're thinking about a group of people in the past with whom you might naturally identify, stop and ask yourself how or why you might empathize with the other side.</p>

        <p>For example, imagine that your ancestors were part of the pioneers and workers that settled California during the great &quot;gold rush&quot; of the mid-eighteenth century. Consider how indigenous people of California, or Hispanics that had settled the area in previous centuries, might have looked at the situation too.</p>
        <h5>4. Imagine Alternate Futures</h5>

        <p>I like to talk about what I call my &quot;history mantra&quot;:</p>
        <blockquote>

            <p>Nothing is natural, and nothing is inevitable.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Studying history is about asking questions about <em>causation</em>: what happened in the past to make things the way they are now?</p>

        <p>One of the great things about my little history mantra---&quot;nothing is natural, and nothing is inevitable&quot;---is that it frees us up to think about how things might have gone differently in the world. So when you are reading about an outcome of a historical event that made the world the way it is today, think for a moment about the alternate possibilities.</p>

        <p>What would have happened if the revolt in Paris in 1871 had succeeded? Or if Japan had decided not to welcome Commodore Perry of the U.S. Navy in the 1860s?</p>

        <p>Thinking about alternate futures can remind us that nothing is pre-ordained in history, and that everything can change too. History doesn't have to be the <em>veneration</em> of the past. Far from it. It can be the imagining of a future.</p>

        <h4>Why Learn History When It's Already on Your Phone?</h4>

        <p>In 2018, Sam Wineburg published a book titled: &quot;Why Learn History (When It's Already on Your Phone).&quot;</p>

        <p>Wineburg is a Professor of Education and History at Stanford History, but you can imagine that students probably ask this question just as much as any professor might. And it's worth considering the answer. If we have access to all of the world's information, and all it takes it a few quick clicks, why bother with history class at all?</p>

        <p>Borrowing from Wineburg, and throwing in my own two cents, I suggest that there are two reasons why you should be excited about taking a history class. And thinking about these two reasons will not only help you understand why you're taking the class, but they'll also orient you to the <em>kind</em> of learning that you can pursue to get a good grade as well as a rewarding experience.</p>
        <h5>Reason One: Studying history in college tells you <em>what</em> to google. In other words it gives you an &quot;analytical framework.&quot;</h5>

        <p>It's easy to look up facts when you know what you're looking for. You don't need a history professor, or a history textbook, to tell you how many people died in World War II. And you don't need to memorize this fact either. You can find the answer on Google pretty quickly.</p>

        <p>But what if you didn't know that World War II existed? It sounds funny, but there are all sorts of conflicts, debates, events, and movements that drive American history that you probably don't know about. That's ok though. It's impossible for anyone to know everything that happened in history.</p>

        <p>Yet, the more you know, the more you are able to see patterns, and to understand how certain factors drive historical change. This is what I mean by having an &quot;analytical framework.&quot; If you know, for example, that poor and disadvantaged women fought for their basic rights in 1910 in New York City, and in 1896 in Kansas, you can use that framework to discover how women in workers' movements drove other events at other times too. Even if you then use Google to figure out all the details.</p>
        <h5>Reason Two: Studying history in college develops &quot;critical thinking skills&quot;. In other words, by learning &quot;how to think historically,&quot; it trains you to think. Period.</h5>

        <p>When you read, study, and write about history, it gives you practice in certain cognitive skills. Just like doing math or science, the more you practice these skills the better you get.</p>

        <p>I'm not talking about memorization, but rather about other kinds of intellectual skills. For example, studying history requires you understand events as having causes and effects. The more you practice this study, the more natural it'll become to question the inevitability of events around you, and this is a skill that can serve you in a variety of ways.</p>

        <p>For another example, historians have to practice cognitive empathy, or &quot;perspective taking,&quot; in order to better understand why conflicts occur. After all, when you study history, you quickly realize that often there are no clear-cut &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; guys. Practicing cognitive empathy sometimes entails trying to understand both sides of a conflict or debate, or it might mean trying to put yourself in the shoes of someone who led a very different life from your own. This skill, having a kind of cognitive plasticity, is one that makes you a better problem solver, whatever you're doing.</p>
