        <h3>What is &quot;Historical Context&quot;?</h3>

        <p>Historical context is the background circumstances, or ideas &quot;in the air,&quot; surrounding a given time period, place, or historical event. You can think of it as the the background details or &quot;setting&quot; of a historical story. More importantly, historians talk about historical context when they want to understand why a specific event happened, or why a person or people did the things they did or thought the things that they thought.</p>

        <h4>Causes vs. Context</h4>

        <p>Because of this, it's easy to confuse an event's context with the causes of an event. A cause is something that brings an effect. The effect may be immediate and obvious, or it may be deeper and not so evident. In all cases, however, it generates a consequence that one can clearly relate to the factor that precipitated the action.</p>

        <p>By contrast, the context is understood as any number of events, or the climate of opinion, that surround the issue at hand. They help to understand its urgency, its importance, its shape, or even its timing. What was happening at the time of the event or the decision that sheds some light on it? In what type of society did the event occur? An urban one? A rich one? An educated one? An unstable one?</p>

        <p>Additionally, context can describe broad, large-scale changes that are occurring in a society. Is a society urbanizing or industrializing? Is it undergoing cultural change? Even processes that take place over decades or even centuries can inform how we think historically about a single event.</p>

        <h4>An Example: The 1992 Los Angeles Uprising</h4>

        <p>Let's take a single example, the riots in Los Angeles in 1992, sometimes called the &quot;1992 Los Angeles Uprising.&quot; They were sparked by a single incident---the acquittal of the Los Angeles Police Department officers that had assaulted an African American motorist in 1991. The original assault and the later acquittal can both be understood as the <em>causes</em> of the uprising.</p>

        <p>We can zoom out to get <em>context</em>. In this case, Los Angeles was a city with very deep tensions between its black and white residents, and between the police force and the city's citizens. In the prior decade, the LAPD increasingly began adopting harsh and violent tactics to combat drug-related violence. At the same time, a decades-long process of &quot;economic globalization&quot; saw Los Angeles become a nexus of international trade with Asia, but local factory jobs were slowly disappearing, making the rich richer and the poor poorer. All of this is the <em>context</em>, the background, or what was &quot;in the air&quot; at the time of the 1992 Los Angeles Uprising.</p>

        <h3>Writing to an Audience: Why Is It So Important?</h3>

        <p>In the writing activities for this course, I will likely ask you to write for a &quot;general educated audience.&quot; That means you're writing for people that have a basic comprehension of the world, but no <em>specialist</em> knowledge. So why is thinking about your audience important?</p>

        <p>We all communicate differently depending on who we are talking with. You probably speak differently when you're with a parent than when you're with a close friend.</p>

        <p>In an academic context, people speak differently to one another based on the amount of knowledge that they have. Simply, if you're talking to someone who knows everything about King Philip's War, you don't need to go over the basics of the conflict with them. But if you're giving a presentation about the war to people that have never heard of it, you need to start with the basics.</p>

        <p>I want to you imagine your audience as a general, educated one because it means that you can most naturally demonstrate what you are learning about history. By writing to a general audience, you are showing your professor that you have a grasp of the content. In other words, it makes your learning <em>visible</em>. And the more visible your learning is, the better grade you will earn.</p>

        <p>And also because it means you'll be prepared to go on to discuss history with your friends, family, and co-workers at an appropriate level. And that's why we're here in the first place.</p>

        <p>Here are three tips for keeping audience in mind:</p>

        <p>1. <strong>Err on the side of providing too much background information</strong>. There's not much of a downside to writing more words. And it's better than not providing enough information.</p>

        <p>(You can use good paragraph organization and clear topic sentences if you're concerned that too much descriptive writing will dilute your main points.)</p>

        <p><strong>2. Ask yourself: are you making a <em>reference</em> to an idea or event, when you should be <em>describing</em> the idea or event instead?</strong> Consider if your imagined audience will understand a reference well enough to follow your line of argumentation. When in doubt, <em>describe</em>, don't <em>reference</em>.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Avoid writing in any terms that only I or your classmates would understand.</strong> For example, don't say &quot;in last week's reading, we learned about...&quot; or &quot;The textbook says...&quot; or &quot;in class...&quot;. Just describe what it is that you're talking about instead. Imagine the class doesn't exist, and you're just writing to someone in a different context.</p>

        <h3>When Should I Quote and When Should I Paraphrase?</h3>

        <p>When you're about to incorporate text from an outside source into your own writing, the first step is to determine if you should actually use a direct quote or not. Many of us use quotes when using our words instead will make our writing more clear. So it's a good idea to ask yourself:</p>

        <h4>IS THE TEXT:</h4>

        <p>Strikingly original in its phrasing?<br>
            <em>or</em>
        </p>

        <p>Illuminating because of its specific language?<br>
            <em>or</em>
        </p>

        <p>Impossible to paraphrase and retain its importance to your argument?</p>

        <h4>IF THE ANSWER IS NO:</h4>

        <p>Paraphrase, don't quote. Explain fully, using your own words.</p>

        <p>Cite your source, unless the statement is &quot;common knowledge.&quot; Give credit where it's due.</p>

        <h4>IF THE ANSWER IS YES:</h4>

        <p>Introduce the quote. This generally means mentioning the quote's source, in your own words, and also might include mentioning why the source is relevant or significant. (See the next page.)</p>

        <p>Integrate the quote into the flow of your sentences. Quoted sentences should never stand alone.</p>

        <p>Limit yourself to a total of 1-2 sentences of quotes per paragraph. Another good rule of thumb is to limit your total quote usage to 10 percent of your total words for an essay or short response.</p>

        <p>Don't let the quote stand alone. Following the quote, explain what it means and why it's important to the point that you're making.</p>

        <p>Aim to use roughly twice as many of your own words (or more!) to explain a quote as compared to the number of words in the quote itself.</p>

        <p>A good rule of thumb: Never end a paragraph with a quote.</p>

        <p>Cite your source.</p>

        <h4>More on Quotes: How to Do a &quot;Quote Sandwich&quot;</h4>

        <p>To elaborate on the characteristics of good quotation usage, let's look at two example paragraphs below: a &quot;Hit and Run Quote&quot; (bad) and a &quot;Quote Sandwich&quot; (good).</p>
        <h5>Hit and Run Quote</h5>
        <blockquote>

            <p>In the 1930s, John Maynard Keynes was an economist on the outside looking in‚ a rebel who dared to challenge the orthodoxy of classical economics. Yet by the 1970s, his theories and prescriptions, which called for distributive policies and deficit spending, had become the reigning paradigm in American politics. Even Richard Nixon agreed. &quot;I am now a Keynesian in economics.&quot;</p>

            <p>John Maynard Keynes was born....</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The above example isn't all bad. The quote above is brief and punchy. And the speaker of the quote, Richard Nixon, is mentioned. But the mention is brief, and it isn't altogether clear that the quote is his words. Worse, the quote sits as its own sentence. And it ends the paragraph. The reader is left hanging to figure out what it all means and how it relates to the larger point.</p>
        <h5>Quote Sandwich</h5>

        <p>The following example is better, because it's a true quote sandwich. The speaker of the quote isn't just introduced, but we're given all of the relevant information that we need about them. Also notice how the quote doesn't just sit alone as its own sentence. And after the quote, the author of this paragraph tells us why they used the quote in the first place. Finally, note that in this example, the quote is properly cited too, using MLA style.</p>
        <blockquote>

            <p>In the 1930s, John Maynard Keynes was an economist on the outside looking in‚ a rebel who dared to challenge the orthodoxy of classical economics. Yet by the 1970s, his theories and prescriptions, which called for distributive policies and deficit spending, had become the reigning paradigm in American politics. Even President Richard M. Nixon, who we identify with a Republican Party at odds with Keynesian sentiments, famously said &quot;I am now a Keynesian in economics&quot; in 1971 (Silk). By making such a declaration, he was himself highlighting how novel this fact was; even the anti-communist President of the United States had come to see the value of economic ideas that were considered radically left-wing forty years before.</p>

            <p>John Maynard Keynes was born...</p>

        <h3>Five More Miscellaneous Writing Tips</h3>

        <p>There's only so much time in the day. If you focus on <em>just</em> two things in your writing, make it <strong>audience</strong> and <strong>quote usage</strong>.</p>

        <p>But what else is important beyond that? Here are five more quick tips to improve your writing that will improve your grades.</p>

        <h4>Avoid Passive Voice</h4>

        <p>&quot;Passive voice&quot; is what we call it when the subject of your statement isn't clear. For example, in the sentence &quot;the ball was caught,&quot; you don't know who caught the ball.</p>

        <p>President Ronald Reagan once got into trouble for using the passive voice when he said &quot;mistakes were made.&quot; He was called out, and rightly so, because this sentence construction conveniently omits who was making the mistakes!</p>

        <h4>Avoid Sports Fan Syndrome</h4>

        <p>Sometimes when your favorite professional sports team does really well, you might say something like &quot;<em>we</em> won the game last night!&quot; Of course, you weren't on the playing field. It's just a weird way that people express the way they feel connected to &quot;their&quot; team.</p>

        <p>When talking about American history, we sometimes have the tendency to do the same thing. Try to resist the urge. Instead of saying &quot;we went to war with the British in 1812,&quot; you should say the &quot;United States went to war with the British in 1812.&quot; It's more accurate, and it shows you have a critical and academic perspective.</p>

        <h4>Use Topic Sentences</h4>

        <p>Topic sentences clue your reader into what a paragraph is all about. You can think of them as mini-thesis statements for the paragraph. The idea is that a topic sentence tells your reader what the paragraph is about---it's key kernel of information or most important take away---and then the rest of the paragraph provides the evidence or details to back that statement up, or to give it more nuance.</p>

        <p>In an essay with 100% perfect topic sentences, the reader can theoretically read just the first sentence of each paragraph, and still follow the author's chain of logic/argumentation throughout the piece. In reality, it's hard to make <em>every</em> paragraph have such clarifying topic sentences. But trying to get there is worth the effort.</p>

        <h4>Avoid Clichés and Schmaltzy Writing</h4>

        <p>Clichés come in many forms. They include common sayings like &quot;history repeats itself&quot; or &quot;the devil is in the details.&quot; They tend to be overly general and vague, like &quot;throughout history...&quot; or &quot;since the dawn of time...&quot;</p>

        <p>There are also stylistic clichés, such as including a dictionary definition for a word at the start of your paper. Doing this is rarely more effectively than simply explaining to your reader what they need to know.</p>

        <p>Learning how to spot clichés in your own writing is a skill that takes time to develop. But being aware of the issue is the first step. Proofread carefully, and ask yourself if you're using the best, most specific, and most authentic language to get your points across.</p>

        <p>Further reading on clichés: <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/cliches/">https://writingcenter.unc.edu/cliches/</a>.</p>

        <p>&quot;Schmaltzy writing&quot; is a similar issue. This is an idiosyncratic phrase that your professor uses for writing that is overly or dramatically corny or sentimental. (The word schmaltzy comes from the Yiddish language.) Often, when writing about difficult concepts like racism or gender discrimination, we feel a tendency to conclude our essays with rousing calls for equality, tolerance, and understanding. Such calls are good examples of schmaltz. Sometimes it just feels good to write schmaltzy writing, other times it might be used as a cheap or lazy way to &quot;score points&quot; or conclude your thoughts quickly and neatly.</p>

        <p>A little schmaltzy writing every once in a while may be unavoidable, but you want to limit the degree to which you include such simple sentiments that racism is bad or mutual understanding is good, or that a better tomorrow is coming. These all might be true, but surely these are clichés too, and they can take away the emphasis that you should be putting on higher level analysis and context. In short, schmaltzy writing distracts from what is complex and sophisticated about the points that you are making.</p>

        <h4>Avoid Asking Questions in Your Writing</h4>

        <p>It's tempting, at times, to pose rhetorical questions when you want to get a particular point across. As a general rule, however, it's always more effective to simply state the point you want to get across. If you find yourself using question marks in your writing, see if you can make the same points using declarative statements instead.</p>
