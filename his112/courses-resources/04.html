        <h3>How to Write a Good Discussion Question</h3>

        <p>So, your professor has asked you to write discussion questions, based on one or more readings, to bring to class.</p>

        <p>Sounds easy enough, but it turns out there's a skill and an art to crafting good discussion questions.</p>

        <h4>1. Begin by Reading Actively</h4>

        <p>If you're having trouble coming up with discussion questions, you have a <strong>reading</strong> problem and not a <strong>writing</strong> problem.</p>

        <p>Reading actively makes it easier to write a discussion question as you're going, or when you're done.</p>

        <p>So be sure to review the material we have on active reading. In short, you'll want to write down notes for each part of the reading that seems important, contestable, detestable, or surprising. You'll want to make notes of where and how the author speaks to themes from the course, themes from your life, or where and how the author speaks to other voices you've encountered. Above all you'll want to make sure you note the author's argument, favored keywords, biases, and ideologies.</p>

        <h4>2. Compose a Question</h4>

        <p>To make it easier to come up with a good question, we can think of different categories for what questions <em>do</em>. This is not an exhaustive list, so don't worry if you've got a question that doesn't fit.</p>

        <p>a) Thematic Questions: questions that relate the reading to a course theme. The more specific you can be in a thematic question the better.</p>

        <p>b) Connecting Questions: questions that connect the reading to a different reading (or lecture topic). These tend to work best when there is <em>contrast</em> or <em>disagreement</em>.</p>

        <p>c) Implication Questions: questions that ask your classmates about the implications of something stated or implied in the reading.</p>

        <p>Implication questions can be really effective when you take the author's logic seriously, and then ask what happens when applied in different situations or contexts.</p>

        <p>They are most effective when they remain focused on the author's main argument or the &quot;statements that matter.&quot; Generally speaking, don't dwell on nitpicky details or trivia.</p>

        <p>As you're looking back over your notes and the text that you've just read, think about how it might be interesting or provocative to place the text in conversation with course themes or other readings. Often times, the above question categories overlap---it's quite likely that in contrasting one reading with another, you'll also be asking questions about what such a discussion implies for course themes, for example.</p>

        <h4>2b. The &quot;They Say/I Say&quot; Approach</h4>

        <p>If you're still having difficulty coming up with a good discussion question, it might help to use the &quot;They Say / I Say&quot; approach, inspired by the excellent book on writing by Gerald Graff and Cathy Birkenstein.</p>

        <p>Such an approach might use the following template as a jumping off point:</p>
        <blockquote>

            <p>X says ____. Y says ____. This makes me wonder/ask/think, ____?</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Which might look something like this:</p>
        <blockquote>

            <p>In the 2017 film Mother!, Darren Aronofsky appears to deploy Biblical themes in order to justify misanthropy. In Paul Schrader's First Reformed, however, Biblical themes are used to suggest the need for empathy. How can we reconcile these two films as both being about climate change?</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h4>3. Find the Questions that Extend Naturally from Your Initial Question</h4>

        <p>Most good discussion questions are actually multiple questions in sequence. Try to add at least one more question as a natural extension of your initial question, to form a &quot;two-part&quot; question.</p>

        <p>Here's an example of an extensive question:</p>
        <blockquote>

            <p>&quot;When Peter Fonda's character says 'We blew it,' to Dennis Hopper in Easy Rider, is he suggesting that their search for an authentic life failed? Or is he suggesting that such a search is doomed to fail from the outset? What does this imply about the radical individualism at the heart of the film? Does it negate the values embedded in the 'freedom' speech that Jack Nicholson delivers earlier in the film?&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>If your question at first seems too simple or &quot;easy to answer,&quot; it's often the case that you just need to extend it with more questions.</p>

        <h4>4. Root the Question in the Text</h4>

        <p>Good discussion questions are <em>always</em> rooted in the text. That means a couple of things.</p>

        <p>First, it means that your question should include a page number where applicable, and it should include a quote. Usually you'll find your question is actually multiple sentences, with the first sentence being the quote, and the second one being the question. (See the &quot;They Say / I Say&quot; template example above.) This is sometimes called the &quot;quote and a question&quot; template.</p>

        <p>Here's an example:</p>
        <blockquote>

            <p>&quot;According to songwriter Kris Kristofferson, 'freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.' Does this run counter to Henry David Thoreau's characterization of what makes someone free? Is Kristofferson a materialist?&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Notice how the first sentence includes a quote. (But the sentence isn't <em>just</em> a quote---the quote is introduced appropriately with an introductory clause.) The first sentence is NOT a question. That's the job for subsequent sentences.</p>

        <p>(Also notice how this example is taking the primary text, the Kris Kristofferson song &quot;Me and Bobby McGee,&quot; and putting it in conversation with another reading. And that it also uses course keywords like &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;materialist.&quot;)</p>

        <p>(Finally, notice how sometimes it's OK, and it can even be provocative, to ask yes/no questions!)</p>

        <p><strong><em>All</em> of your discussion questions should be at least two sentences, using the &quot;quote and a question&quot; formula.</strong></p>

        <p>Rooting a question in the text means something else too. It means that you're not asking a question that requires an outside source for an answer. In a class discussion about a reading, it doesn't go very far to ask a question that we can't answer with the text(s) in front of us.</p>

        <h4>5. Iterate</h4>

        <p>It might be that you thought you had a good question, but that you then realized that it wasn't rooted in the text. That's ok, just come up with a new one, and go back through the process again.</p>

        <p>In the end, you might have two or three discussion questions drafted, and you can determine which one you like best.</p>

        <h4>6. Run Your Discussion Question Through the Checklist</h4>

        <p>a) Is your question open-ended, and/or able to be argued against? In other words, is there more than one &quot;right&quot; or &quot;valid&quot; answer? (If not, might the answer be complex or counter-intuitive enough to spur discussion?)</p>

        <p>b) Does your question have multiple questions? (Or is it otherwise complex enough to stand on its own?)</p>

        <p>c) Does your question follow the multiple-sentence, &quot;quote and a question&quot; template?</p>

        <p>d) Is your question <em>discussable</em> (not necessarily <em>answerable</em>) with the text(s) that are in front of the class?</p>

        <h3>How to Reply in a Class or Online Discussion</h3>

        <p>So you need to respond to a classmate's answer to a discussion question, and you need to do it in a way that is substantive and productive. But how do you do that? A good discussion feels organic and alive. A good discussion depends on a sense that each conversant is paying attention to one another. Listening to and processing another person's comments, opinions, and ideas is as important as presenting your own thoughts in a good discussion.</p>

        <p>You can communicate to others that you are listening and processing the words of others. Here are some templates that might be helpful for understanding how to do it.</p>

        <p>I agree with Mark's point that .... . The textbook has another example of this. It says...</p>

        <p>I agree with Elizabeth, but I think that point overlooks something else that is important too. ...</p>

        <p>Dana makes the point that ... . To play &quot;devil's advocate&quot; though, it's also true that ... .</p>

        <p>Cameron says that ...., but I think there's some evidence to suggest otherwise. .... .</p>

        <p>Carlos, I'm confused by the point that you are making here. On page ..., doesn't the textbook say that ... ?</p>

        <p>Adam, this is really provocative, and it raises an interesting question. If ..., then ....??</p>

        <p>What Tracy says makes me think about this incident that happened last week that was reported in the newspaper ...</p>

        <p>Hopefully you get the idea. Your replies should ideally do two things:</p>

        <p>acknowledge your classmate's main point.</p>

        <p>introduce a new perspective, and/or new evidence, and/or a new provocative question.</p>

        <h4>Strategies for Moving the Discussion Forward</h4>

        <p>The art of discussion is all about &quot;moving the discussion forward.&quot;</p>

        <p>This can be hard sometimes. Really hard. Our tendency as human beings is to want to agree with our interlocutors, and that's usually a good thing! But not in academic discussion.</p>

        <p>So here are some tips:</p>

        <p>- Use evidence that hasn't been raised in the discussion yet. <strong>Look at the text again</strong>. This is important. Then you can find a quote that hasn't been used yet, perhaps to back up what someone else has said, or to refute it. It can feel like extra work to have to go back to the text, but it's important; this is how analysis happens.</p>

        <p>- Play devil's advocate. This is easy to do, and it sharpens your critical thinking skills. All you have to do is state that you are playing devil's advocate, and you can &quot;try on&quot; an opinion that may be unpopular, and/or one that you may not hold yourself. This can be enormously helpful for discussion.</p>

        <p>- Bring in outside sources. If you're in an online discussion forum, a quick Google search can sometimes enlighten a conversation, though you do want to vet your sources and understand them in context.</p>

        <p>- Talk about news or current events. It's easy to overdo this, so a good rule is to have a solid source or specific piece of evidence. Same with presenting a personal anecdote---it's okay to do, just bring it back to the substance of the text with your analysis.</p>

        <p>- Make connections. It's ok to reply to another person that their post makes you think of something different, as long as you explain the connection, and link what you want to write about with the original post's subject in a substantive and meaningful way. Your new subject should be backed up with specifics just like any other post.</p>

        <h4>What to Avoid in Online Discussion Forums</h4>

        <p>One book about student writing puts it this way: &quot;<em>don't make them scroll up</em>.&quot; That means that you should summarize the point to which you are responding, and note who was the person that made the point. Then other people know exactly what you're talking about without having to scroll up.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, a secondary mantra to keep in mind is &quot;<em>don't make them look it up</em>.&quot; In other words, if you are referencing an event or concept from your textbook, describe it so that anyone who is reading your post will understand what you are saying. (Do include the page number of the book or article that you are looking at though.)</p>

        <p>This is a good rule for replies, but also for your original posts too.</p>
