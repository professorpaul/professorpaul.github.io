        <h2>Section One: Assignment Descriptions</h2>

        <h3>Quizzes</h3>

        <h4>Module Quizzes</h4>

        <p>These quizzes, of 10 to 15 questions, cover any and all video and reading material from the module.</p>

        <p>(They may also include review questions from the previous one or two modules.)</p>

        <p>Check your responses before submitting. You will have 40 minutes to complete each quiz, and once you run out of time it will submit your responses automatically.</p>

        <p><strong>Important reminder:</strong> Although you are free to refer to course material while taking the quiz, you will find that without an understanding of the content going into the quiz, you simply won’t be able to answer the questions correctly.</p>

        <h4>Mid-Term Quiz and Final Quiz</h4>

        <p>These quizzes will test your knowledge of the content covered in the previous seven or eight modules.</p>

        <p>Check your responses before submitting. You will have 90 minutes to complete each quiz, and once you run out of time it will submit your responses automatically.</p>

        <p><strong>Important reminder</strong>: These questions are designed to test your comprehension of the major themes, arguments, and perspectives that we’ve covered. That means you won’t need to recall what year a certain declaration was signed, or the name of a particular general.</p>

        <p>It does mean that you’ll need a good comprehension, or <em>understanding</em>, or what we’ve covered. That means that you should review the textbook and the other sources we’ve read, and review your notes too.</p>

        <h4>A Note on Multiple Choice Quizzes</h4>

        <p>Some of the multiple choice questions in this course, particularly on the mid-term and final, are designed to test comprehension and other higher-order levels of thinking. That means you will often encounter questions that present multiple “true” statements. In these cases, your job will be to read each possible response carefully, and then choose the best statement that <em>fits best to what the question is asking.</em></p>

        <p>In short, don’t just pick whatever response immediately looks “right.” Choose carefully.</p>

        <h4>Quiz Results</h4>

        <p><strong>After</strong> the deadline for the quiz has passed, you will be able to see the full results of each quiz, including the correct answers for each question that you marked incorrectly.</p>

        <h3>Primary Source Analysis #1 (Warm-Up)</h3>
        <!-- 2YHAD0QJBK -->

        <h4>The Assignment</h4>

        <p>For this first primary source analysis, you will write two paragraphs based on the primary source reading by Christopher Columbus or Bartolomé de Las Casas. Pick one.</p>

        <p>The steps that you take to analyze this document will be the ones that you continue to perform as you analyze other primary sources throughout the term.</p>

        <p>Each paragraph must consist of at least five sentences.</p>

        <p>Paragraph One: Describe what you know about the document's authorship. This paragraph should answer the questions: who wrote it? What can we discern about their background and/or profession? Does it say where it was written? Then describe the context in which the document was written. What was going on at the time that is relevant to understanding the document? <strong>This is where you will need to draw on your textbook.</strong> Be specific.</p>

        <p><em>Note: Some primary sources do not have all of the information that historians would like them to have! Don't be discouraged if you cannot answer every one of the above questions in your analysis.</em></p>

        <p>(Tip: Review the section on “historical context” in the Course Resources document.)</p>

        <p>Paragraph Two: Summarize the document. What is its main point, or argument? And what details, facts, opinions, or emotions are used to express that point or argument? Be specific. But be concise as well; remember you are offering a summary.</p>

        <h4>Writing Style</h4>

        <p>Remember to follow the “general audience” rule—imagine that you are writing to a general audience that doesn’t know the specifics of American history. That way, you’ll be able to show what you know.</p>

        <p>See the Course Resources document for more information on audience.</p>

        <p>Also, be sure to use quotes judiciously. Overuse of quotes can make your writing unclear. Show me what you know by using your own words, and by following the quotes that you do use with your own interpretations and explanations.</p>

        <p>See the Course Resources document for more information on quoting.</p>

        <h4>Citations</h4>

        <p>If you decide to reference the textbook in your analysis, simply place the page number or section of the textbook in parentheses at the end of your sentence. More formal citations are not required.</p>

        <p>You do not need to cite your primary sources—it should be clear when you are referring to them anyways.</p>

        <h4>Submission</h4>

        <p>Turn in the assignment in Moodle by the deadline. The file must be formatted in .doc, .docx, or .rtf format.</p>

        <h4>Assessment</h4>

        <p>Your primary source analysis will be assessed with the following rubric:</p>

        <table>

        <h3>Primary Source Analysis #2, #3, and #4</h3>
        <!--XZZ3YC9LC7 -->

        <h4>The Assignment</h4>

        <p>Before you start, check the Moodle site and/or the syllabus to determine which primary sources you will be writing about for each primary source analysis.</p>

        <p>For each of the primary source analyses beginning with Primary Source Analysis #2, you will write two paragraphs for <em>each</em> of the primary source readings being analyzed.</p>

        <p>Then you will write a final paragraph that discusses one or both of the documents’ biases or assumptions.</p>

        <p>Each paragraph must consist of at least five sentences. (You will likely need more than that to complete the activity. Do feel free to break up any paragraphs into multiple ones in the interest of style and clarity.)</p>
        <h5>Paragraph One (Background and Context)</h5>

        <p>Choose one of the two documents presented. Describe what you know about the document's authorship. This paragraph should answer the questions: who wrote it? What can we discern about their background and/or profession? Does it say where it was written? Then describe the context in which the document was written. What was going on at the time that is relevant to understanding the document? <strong>This is where you will need to draw on your textbook.</strong> Be specific.</p>

        <p><em>Note: Some primary sources do not have all of the information that historians would like them to have! Don't be discouraged if you cannot answer every one of the above questions in your analysis.</em></p>

        <p>(Tip: Review the section on “historical context” in the Course Resources document.)</p>
        <h5>Paragraph Two (Document Summary)</h5>

        <p>Summarize the document. What is its main point, or argument? And what details, facts, opinions, and stories are used to express that point or argument? Be specific. But be concise as well; remember you are offering a summary.</p>
        <h5>Paragraphs Three and Four</h5>

        <p>Repeat the above processes for the other document—the one that you didn’t choose. That’s how you’ll get your third and fourth paragraphs.</p>

        <p><em>(Tip: The order that you write about the primary sources will affect how you go about your analysis, so choose wisely. Generally, it will make sense to determine which primary source was written or published first, and start with that one.)</em></p>
        <h5>Paragraph Five (Discussion of Bias)</h5>

        <p>Discuss one of the document author’s biases in detail.</p>

        <p>In other words, describe the author’s “worldview,” “ideology,” or “assumptions.” That means identifying the ideas that are “in the air” that are influencing the author, and discussing how those assumptions or biases are reflected in the document. It’s not enough just to identify that an author is biased in a certain way. Discuss how. One good way to do this is to identify a particular quote that appears to us today to have false logic. Another good way to do it is to discuss how another person or group of people at the time might have challenged one of the author’s particular claims or ideas.</p>

        <p>That other person or group of people might be represented by the author of your other reading. You may choose if you want to identify the bias of that author as well. As an alternative, you can show how the second author helps us to think in some way about the bias of the first.</p>

        <p>In either case, your bias paragraph should include some discussion of both documents, even as you focus on one of them.</p>

        <p>(Tip: In deciding which document to center this paragraph around, you can pick whichever you’d like. <strong>But</strong>, it is helpful to pick the one that feels like it has the most strange perspective. In other words, choose the document that seems to hold opinions that are less popular today.)</p>

        <h4>Writing Style</h4>

        <p>Remember to follow the “general audience” rule—imagine that you are writing to a general audience that doesn’t know the specifics of American history. That way, you’ll be able to show what you know.</p>

        <p>See the Course Resources document for more information on audience.</p>

        <p>Also, be sure to use quotes judiciously. Overuse of quotes can make your writing unclear. Show me what you know by using your own words, and by following the quotes that you do use with your own interpretations and explanations.</p>

        <p>See the Course Resources document for more information on quoting.</p>

        <h4>Citations</h4>

        <p>If you decide to reference the textbook in your analysis, simply place the page number or section of the textbook in parentheses at the end of your sentence. More formal citations are not required.</p>

        <p>You do not need to cite your primary sources—it should be clear when you are referring to them anyways.</p>

        <h4>Submission</h4>

        <p>Turn in the assignment in Moodle by the deadline. The file must be formatted in .doc, .docx, or .rtf format.</p>

        <h4>Assessment</h4>

        <h3>Discussion Forum Posts</h3>

        <h4>The Assignment—Round One</h4>

        <p>Respond to <strong>each</strong> of the posted discussion questions with well thought-out responses. Your responses should be five sentences or more.</p>

        <p>Remember, there's no right or wrong answer. But you should back up your responses with details from the textbook (or another source.)</p>

        <p>When you are pulling a detail or quote from the textbook, just put the page number in parentheses at the end of the sentence.</p>

        <p>Describe what you're talking about fully. Remember, even though you're talking to your classmates, they are new to this material too. They shouldn't have to turn to the textbook to get a sense of what you are talking about.</p>

        <p>(See the Course Resources document for more on thinking about “audience” as you write.)</p>

        <p>Feel free to end with a question, one that's posed to your classmates, that might take the conversation in a different direction. You all are in charge of where the discussion goes.</p>

        <p><strong>See Section Two of this document for a sample discussion forum post.</strong></p>

        <h4>The Assignment—Round Two</h4>

        <p>At the start of the <em>following</em> module, you will return to the <em>previous</em> week’s discussion forum. Since you already posted there, you will be able to see everything your classmates have written.</p>

        <p>Now it's time for Round Two for that forum's questions.</p>

        <p>Respond to at least one of your classmates for <strong>each</strong> of the posted prompts, or &quot;threads.&quot; Keep it respectful. Acknowledge your classmates' response, and then describe how their response contrasts with your observations and/or analysis. Or you can acknowledge how your classmate made you think about something in a new way, and then you can add to their response with further evidence or analysis.</p>

        <p>Whatever you choose to do, write a well thought out, five sentence response, referencing details and page numbers (where applicable) from the textbook or other readings.</p>

        <p>(Tip: Remember, the purpose of a discussion forum post is to <strong>move the conversation forward.</strong> That means that it’s not enough to agree with or confirm what another student is saying. And it’s not enough to reiterate what you stated previously. Your job is to bring in new evidence, a new perspective, a new connection, a new interpretation, a new outside source, or a new substantive question.)</p>

        <p><strong>See Section Two of this document for a sample “templates” for discussion forum replies.</strong></p>

        <h4>Going Above and Beyond</h4>

        <p>Feel free to respond beyond the required two replies. Extra responses certainly don't need to be fully five sentences or loaded with detail. It’s good if they introduce new evidence or insights though.</p>

        <h4>Current Events</h4>

        <p>I welcome connections to &quot;current events,&quot; but take care to respect your classmates that may have different feelings. <strong>Avoid generalizations and cliches</strong> (like &quot;feminists are whiny&quot; or &quot;gun owners don't care about children&quot;). Instead, cite facts and legitimate sources.</p>

        <p>(See the Course Resources document for how to search for and select legitimate sources. Discussing outside sources can be a great way to liven up a discussion and meet the requirements for your replies.)</p>

        <p>And always, question what your own presumptions are! Don't just repeat what you've heard in your community without thinking first.</p>

        <h4>Have Fun</h4>

        <p>Have fun with this! Feel free to ask follow-up questions of one another. Sometimes changing the topic can be useful.</p>

        <p>Personally, I love to play devil's advocate. You can adopt a position that is not your own, as long as it's well-reasoned and/or backed up by details from our readings. This can shake up discussions. Feel free to just say, &quot;I don't think this is really what I think, but...&quot;)</p>

        <h4>Submission</h4>

        <p>Post your discussion forum contributions on the appropriate Moodle discussion forums. <strong>Do NOT</strong> attach external files with your writing inside; use the built-in text editor to post.</p>

        <p>(You may want to draft your posts in <a href="https://office.live.com/start/Word.aspx">Microsoft Word</a>; just copy and paste when you are ready to post. Word is more reliable; sometimes Moodle might lose your &quot;drafts&quot;.)</p>

        <h4>Assessment</h4>

        <p>Your discussion forum posts will be assessed using the following rubrics, for the first round of posts and the second round, respectively.</p>
