        <h2>Section Two: Sample Assignments and Templates</h2>

        <h3>Sample Primary Source Analysis #1</h3>

        <p>Below is a sample set of paragraphs, written in response to <a href="http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5575/">a primary source interview given by President McKinley, on the subject of the American annexation of the Philippines</a>. You can model your primary source analyses off of these sample paragraphs. Notice how the summary in the second paragraph begins with a topic sentence that gets to the gist of the interview’s meaning/argument.</p>
        <blockquote>

            <p>William McKinley was the President of the United States of America when he delivered this interview in 1899. The United States, under his leadership, had fought and won a war with Spain in 1898. Having defeated Spain, that country’s former colonies fell into the possession of the United States. And although the U.S. had gone to war ostensibly to free one of those colonies—Cuba—it now had to decide what power it would exert over that and other nations. The U.S. never had overseas territory before, but with the annexation of Hawaii, it had the sudden potential to become an empire.</p>

            <p>In this interview, McKinley is making the case for keeping control over the Philippines, an island nation in the Pacific Ocean that Spain had been in control of. McKinley begins by acknowledging that not every American was in favor of taking the country over. He defends his position by arguing that the alternatives would have been to either give the nation to Germany and France, or to allow the Filipinos to govern themselves. And he says that doing the former would have been “bad business,” suggesting that the U.S. was in competition with France and Germany, and that doing the latter would have been bad because he thought the Filipinos were not ready for self-government. Invoking religious language, McKinley states that God told him that the U.S. must rule over the Philippines, and to educate and “civilize” the nation. He concludes by boasting that the Philippines would now be a part of the United States.</p>

        <h3>Sample Primary Source Analysis #2, #3, #4</h3>

        <p>Below is a sample set of paragraphs, written in response to <a href="http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5575/">a primary source interview given by President McKinley</a>, on the subject of the American annexation of the Philippines; and <a href="http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/gilded/empire/text9/filipino.pdf">a magazine article written by a Filipino government official</a>. You can model your paper’s organization and style off of this example:</p>
        <blockquote>

            <p>William McKinley was the President of the United States of America when he delivered this interview in 1899. The United States, under his leadership, had fought and won a war with Spain in 1898. Having defeated Spain, that country’s former colonies fell into the possession of the United States. And although the U.S. had gone to war ostensibly to free one of those colonies—Cuba—it now had to decide what power it would exert over that and other nations. The U.S. never had overseas territory before, but with the annexation of Hawaii, it had the sudden potential to become an empire.</p>

            <p>In this interview, McKinley is making the case for keeping control over the Philippines, an island nation in the Pacific Ocean that Spain had been in control of. McKinley begins by acknowledging that not every American was in favor of taking the country over. He defends his position by arguing that the alternatives would have been to either give the nation to Germany and France, or to allow the Filipinos to govern themselves. And he says that doing the former would have been “bad business,” suggesting that the U.S. was in competition with France and Germany, and that doing the latter would have been bad because he thought the Filipinos were not ready for self-government. Invoking religious language, McKinley states that God told him that the U.S. must rule over the Philippines, and to educate and “civilize” the nation. He concludes by boasting that the Philippines would now be a part of the United States.</p>

            <p>“Aguinaldo’s Case Against the United States” is a letter written by an anonymous source close to Emilio Aguinaldo, published in the American magazine North American Review. Aguinaldo was the leader of the Filipino independence movement, and in 1899, became President of the country. That same year, when this letter was written, Aguinaldo had been leading the Filipino resistance against President McKinley’s American forces. Whereas the U.S. saw itself as liberators in the Spanish-American War, Emilio Aguinaldo had been fighting Spain for two years before the United States even showed up. He continued to fight for his country’s independence regardless of which imperial power—Spain or America—sought to control his country.</p>

            <p>Aguinaldo’s proxy makes the case that America is wrong to attempt to occupy and control the Philippines. He makes his case in two ways. First, he points out the ways that the United States is being hypocritical by talking about freedom and self-determination in its founding rhetoric, but by imposing “government by force” in the Philippines. He demands of the United States, “treat us exactly as you demanded to be treated at the hands of England,” making a direct comparison between the United States’s fight for independence and that of the Filipinos. Second, he critiques the charge on the part of Americans that the Philippines are not ready for self-government. According to Aguinaldo’s representative, this idea stems from the stereotypes that Americans have of Filipinos as uncivilized. Again, he compares the Philippines to the United States, noting that few believed that the North American colonies would be able to govern themselves after their break with England.</p>

            <p>McKinley’s perspective appears to stem from a couple of assumptions. First, he is looking at the international arena primarily through a “business” or “commerce” lens. In other words, he seems to believe that doing what is good for the country’s trade is better than doing what is just for the various nations in the world. Second, he has bought into certain racist notions about who among the world are “civilized,” and so he couldn’t recognize that the Philippines had a right to be independent. Aguinaldo’s proxy makes this very case. He writes that Americans have “been greatly deceived” by “American journals” and the “popular press” to believe that Filipinos are “ignorant savages.” In doing so, he is pointing out the bias that stems from the circulation of racist depictions of non-white peoples. Writing as a national demanding independence, he quite naturally comes with a different bias: that of wanting to be able to live in a country that is freely governed, and absent an imperialist war.</p>

        <h3>Sample Discussion Forum Post</h3>

        <p>Notice how the example post below is the requisite length. Also, it begins with a nice topic sentence responding directly to the prompt. Most importantly, it uses specific evidence, and a quote, to back up its main point. A reference to the textbook’s page number appears in parentheses. Next, notice that it ends by posing a provocative question that relates to the initial prompt. Finally, the student here isn’t afraid to ask a more grounded question based in confusion about the textbook’s content.</p>

        <p>Additionally, notice that it’s written in a clear but conversational tone—no need to get too stuffy in a discussion board.</p>

        <h4>Example Discussion Forum Prompt</h4>
        <blockquote>

            <p>Agree or Disagree with this statement:</p>
            <blockquote>

                <p>“African Americans didn’t really find freedom in the decade after the American Civil War.”</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Remember, there’s no right or wrong answer. Use specific details and evidence to back up your stance.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h4>Example Post</h4>
        <blockquote>

            <p>Practically speaking, it seems like African Americans were not really free after the Civil War. For example, the textbook describes the black codes, which were laws that were passed throughout the former Confederate South. These laws made it a crime for blacks to vote, or they put poor blacks into prison just for not having jobs, and made them work without any pay in return. One white southerner is even quoted as saying “the ex-slave was not a free man; he was a free Negro” (518). It’s a weird distinction, but he seems to be saying that black people weren’t free people.</p>

            <p>This raises an interesting question—what is it that makes people free? Is it the right to vote? Or is it the ability to get income?</p>

            <p>Also, I’m a little confused about the difference between a tenant farmer, a sharecropper, and debt peonage? Anyone else find this section confusing?</p>

        <h4>Discussion Forum Replies: Sample Templates</h4>

        <p>A good discussion feels organic and alive. A good discussion depends on a sense that each conversant is paying attention to one another. Listening to and processing another person’s comments, opinions, and ideas is as important as presenting your own thoughts in a good discussion.</p>

        <p>You can communicate to others that you are listening and processing the words of others. Here are some templates that might be helpful for understanding how to do it:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>I agree with Mark’s point that .... . The textbook has another example of this. It says...</li>
            <li>I agree with Elizabeth, but I think that point overlooks something else that is important too. ...</li>
            <li>Dana makes the point that ... . To play “devil’s advocate” though, it’s also true that ... .</li>
            <li>Cameron says that ...., but I think there’s some evidence to suggest otherwise. .... .</li>
            <li>Carlos, I’m confused by the point that you are making here. On page ..., doesn’t the textbook say that ... ?</li>
            <li>Adam, this is really provocative, and it raises an interesting question. If ..., then ....??</li>
            <li>What Tracy says makes me think about this incident that happened last week that was reported in the newspaper ...</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Hopefully you get the idea. Your replies should ideally do two things:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>acknowledge your classmate’s main point.</li>
            <li>introduce a new perspective, and/or new evidence, and/or a new provocative and substantive question.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>(Tip: It might seem strange, but you should aim to spend as much time on your follow-up posts as you do on your first post in a discussion.)</strong></p>

        <h4>“Don’t Make Them Look It Up”</h4>

        <p>A good mantra to keep in mind when writing is “don’t make them look it up.”</p>

        <p>In other words, if you are referencing an event or concept from your textbook, describe it so that anyone who is reading your post will understand what you are saying. (Do include the page or section number of the book or article that you are looking at though.)</p>

        <p>Similarly, you don’t want to make your readers scroll up to previous posts. Summarize briefly.</p>

        <p>This is a good rule for replies, but also for your original posts too.</p>
